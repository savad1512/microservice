Project Title: Scalable Kubernetes Deployment with ALB Ingress and CI/CD
Project Overview:
You will build a highly available and automated CI/CD pipeline that deploys a containerized application on Amazon EKS (Kubernetes) with ALB Ingress for traffic routing. The pipeline will use Jenkins and Argo CD for continuous integration and deployment, Terraform for infrastructure provisioning, and Ansible for configuration management.

Tech Stack & Tools Used:
✅ AWS Services – EKS, ALB, IAM, S3, Route 53, VPC, RDS (optional)
✅ Terraform – Infrastructure as Code (IaC) for AWS setup
✅ Git – Version control for codebase and Terraform state management
✅ Jenkins – CI/CD pipeline setup
✅ Argo CD – Continuous Deployment (CD) for GitOps workflow
✅ Docker – Containerizing the application
✅ Kubernetes (EKS) – Orchestrating containerized workloads
✅ Ansible – Automating server and Jenkins configuration
✅ ALB Ingress Controller – Load balancing for Kubernetes services

Project Architecture:
Infrastructure as Code (Terraform):

Provision AWS EKS cluster with worker nodes

Deploy ALB Ingress Controller

Create necessary IAM roles and security groups

Configure S3 for artifact storage

CI/CD Pipeline (Jenkins + Argo CD):

Jenkins will build the Docker image, push it to AWS ECR, and trigger Argo CD

Argo CD will sync Kubernetes manifests from GitHub repository and deploy to EKS

Containerized Application (Docker + Kubernetes):

Sample web app (Node.js, Python, or Java)

Dockerized and deployed in Kubernetes

Managed using Helm charts or Kubernetes manifests

Ingress Setup (ALB Ingress Controller):

Configured to expose the application via Route 53 domain

Uses AWS Certificate Manager (ACM) for HTTPS

Step-by-Step Implementation:
1️⃣ Infrastructure Setup with Terraform
Use Terraform to create VPC, EKS, ALB, IAM roles, and security groups

Deploy ALB Ingress Controller for routing

2️⃣ Application Containerization with Docker
Build a Dockerfile for a sample web application

Push the image to AWS ECR

3️⃣ Kubernetes Deployment with ALB Ingress
Define Kubernetes manifests (Deployment, Service, Ingress)

Use ALB Ingress Controller for routing

4️⃣ CI/CD Pipeline with Jenkins & Argo CD
Jenkins pipeline:

Pull latest code from GitHub

Build & push Docker image to AWS ECR

Update Kubernetes manifests

Trigger Argo CD sync

Argo CD watches Git repository for updates and deploys to EKS

5️⃣ Ansible for Configuration Management
Automate Jenkins installation and EKS worker node setup using Ansible
